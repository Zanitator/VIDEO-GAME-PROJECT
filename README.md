Title: Third-person shooter/rogue-like co-op game

Description:
This is a co-operative game that combines elements of third-person shooters and rogue-likes. Players will face waves of enemies while equipping themselves with randomly generated weapons and items from a vast catalog of fun and varied gameplay options. These weapons and items can modify the player's mobility, health, and other attributes, resulting in a unique experience for each playthrough. Additionally, players will unlock a set of utility skills for survival during the game, such as temporary invincibility, small teleportation abilities, and increased running speed.

The game will consist of five worlds, each with a different boss fight at the end, with unique and enjoyable patterns. Unlike traditional rogue-likes, the levels will not be procedurally generated, but rather a single, designed version with only part of the zone accessible at the start. Players must complete a series of stages to progress through the game.

Overall, this game aims to provide an exciting and challenging co-operative experience for players. While there is currently no team or budget for the project, we are seeking collaborators who share our vision and are interested in helping to bring this game to life. If you are interested in working on this project with us, please do not hesitate to contact me to learn more.

Note: The project name is still VIDEO-GAME-PROJECT, but we can change it if desired.
